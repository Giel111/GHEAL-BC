This repo consists of the following files:

1. Thesis: my full thesis 
2. Appendix IX: Full code explanation consisting of the documentation of my model code
3. GHEAL-BC for Documentation: Full code used for documentation
4. GHEAL-BC for 2k: Full code used for 2k factorial
5. GHEAL-BC Parallel: Full code fit for parallel execution
6. StagingFromSizes.csv: File consiting of the stage-to-size probability matrix
7. TreatmentCostsVanLuijt2023Eur.csv: Table with the treatment costs per stage and duration
8. PAID_Cost_additional_year_post_BC_Costs_Living_Year_Longer_2023-03-07.csv: Costs for additional life years post BC according to the PAID3.0 tool
9. FindStableSampleSize.R: Used to compute confidence intervals to find a stable sample size
10. TumorGrowCheck.R: small script to analyse and plot the tumor growth rates used in the model


Good luck!
